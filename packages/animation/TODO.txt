Code changes:

Project:
* Create list of diagram animations that I want to animate:
  * Set animations
  * Corps de ballet animation
  * geometry animation
  * an animation that involves deleting objects
  * an animation that involves changing the type of an object?

* make new module from packages, put animation related code in there
* Basically need to need to regenerate “inputs” with constant samplers BETWEEN style 
  compilation and optimization, then sample again with the new samplers to get the constant varying values.
* start by testing the transition between 2 substance programs: take as much of the state from the first visual
  and use it as a starting point for the second one
