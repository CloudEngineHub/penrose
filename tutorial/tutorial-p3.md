# Part 3: Functions 
So far, we've directly declared substances in our diagram, which can then have some relationship with other substances in the diagram by the use of predicates. Now we will introduce functions in Penrose, which allow us to compose atomic substances in the diagram and define new substances based on existing ones.

## Starter Code
This example is a bit more involved than the previous tutorials, therefore we will be providing you some starter code to get things running. 
Download the [starter code here](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/tree/docs-edit/tutorial/starter-code/tutorial-p3), and you should see this in your browser. 

## Goal
![Tutorial 3 Goal]()
We will be defining a function `addV` that takes in 2 two dimensional vectors `u`, `v` and outputs a new vector `w` in the normal vector addition way, i.e. `u=<a, b>, v=<c,d>, w=u+v=<a+c, b+d>`.
